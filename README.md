Jest unit tests

# how to use
`npm run test` 
runs jest

`npm run test -t <target>`
This will run tests for your specific test file

`npm run test -t unit`
This runs all tests in my unit folder

So far, all the tests inside the unit folder are unit tests.
Further iterations will include integration and function tests.

Enzyme tests will be hosted on a separate repos.
